# LeaseTrix
It is a self drive car rental system where people can rent cars based upon their needs. By this system, the customers can book the car, get its confirmations done by the admin and use it for their needs.
In this system, users can view various cars that are being available for their ride and also their accessories like seats,AC availability, etc., But to book them one must sign in to the page creating a session and request to book the car. But their bookings are confirmed only after the Admin approval.
